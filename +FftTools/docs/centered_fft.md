# Centered fft

The functions `fft2c`, `ifft2c`, `fftc` and `ifftc` all implement their counterpart MATLAB functions (`fft2`, `ifft`, etc.) using imaging conventions for fftshifts and scaling.

The code in them is pretty short so any remaining questions perhaps can be answered by reading the functions directly.
